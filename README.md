# Description: #

Our project, named GIPI, can be defined as a new generation GPS for bicycles. Indeed, in order to ensure the safety of its user, it transmits the guidance indications by spatialized vibrations.
This idea is based on a problem that arises very frequently in the daily life of a person working in the field of delivery (food, postal parcels, etc.). Indeed, currently, the bicycle is one of the means of transport most used by delivery people to carry out their professional activity. In this context, they get to their destination by following the directions displayed on their phone. Unfortunately, driving safely while ensuring that they follow the correct route is not possible. Indeed, it exposes delivery drivers to accidents, especially knowing that they are driving alongside larger motorised vehicles. So the question is, how can we enable delivery drivers to get to an unknown destination without risk?
Well, our project aims to solve this problem by allowing delivery drivers to follow a path to a destination without having to follow visual directions. To do this, the driver will be equipped with an adjustable belt around the torso or waist, consisting of an electronic box that allows him to choose a route and four vibrators, placed at each end of the belt, whose role is to transmit guidance without having to take his eyes off the road.

# Usage scenarios: #

The nominal use scenario of our project is quite simple. Indeed, we place ourselves in the case of a delivery person wishing to go to an arrival point without knowing the path to follow. Our solution consists of asking him to select a route that has been previously added to a database by the company that employs him. Once this track has been selected, the guidance can begin.
